        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spruce up that instant chicken ramen by adding actual protein and veggies that yields a creamy broth. This is my take on instant ramen/egg drop soup. Top with chopped chives and crispy wonton strips if desired. They are sold as a salad topping and can be found with croutons.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
         <li>1 (3 ounce) package chicken flavored ramen noodles</li>
         <li>2 cups water</li>
         <li>Â½ cup frozen peas and carrots</li>
         <li>1 large egg</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
         <li>Break up noodles and place in a microwave safe bowl. Add water and frozen veggie mix. Microwave on high 7 minutes.</li>
         <li>Meanwhile whisk egg, mayonnaise, and season packet from the instant ramen together in a large bowl.</li>
         <li>Temper egg mixture by ladling 1/4 cup of the boiling water from the noodles, whisking until combined. Ladle another 1/4 cup of the boiling water whisking until egg is "cooked" and completely incorporated.</li>
         <li>Add remaining liquid and the noodles. Let sit until the noodles have absorbed the majority of the liquid, about 3 minutes.</li>
         <li>Ladle into 2 serving bowls and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
